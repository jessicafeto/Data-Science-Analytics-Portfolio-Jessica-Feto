        "Reddit posts, focusing on Starbucks-related keywords.\n",
        "2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Used regular expressions, NLTK for natural language processing, and other Python libraries to clean and preprocess the text data, removing unnecessary elements like emojis and URLs.\n",
        "3. **Sentiment Analysis:** Used TextBlob to perform sentiment analysis on the cleaned data, classifying sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
        "4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducts statistical analysis and visualizations like word clouds and histograms to explore the data characteristics.\n",
        "5. **Topic Modeling:** Applied LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) for topic modeling to uncover underlying themes in the social media content.\n",
        "6. **Final Data Representation**: The cleaned, processed, and analyzed data is saved into CSV files for further use and visualization purposes, providing insights into the public sentiment regarding Starbucks on social media platforms."

our ovens literally set the pastries on fire cookies would light on fire sandwiches will not cook all the way through they are still waiting on new ovens we finally got new espresso machines the beginning of this year how does a billion dollar company not have the funds to outfit every store with quality equipment thirdly and this has nothing to do with the company… although they encourage this “customization” culture the customers are % entitled assholes even when i worked at olive garden mcdonald’s cheddars etc i never encountered some of these kinds of people i got cursed out for being out of sugar free vanilla i got yelled at through the speaker box because i was out of caramel drizzle i got complained about because this man was yelling at me about how he wanted his latte made & i corrected him for being an asshole respectfully with much effort a man once asked me for exactly  ice cubes i was making someone else’s drink with the standard scoop of ice and he threw a fit thinking it was his drink i looked at him dead in the eye and said “this is not your drink” his face turned red from embarrassment and he sat his ass down people complained about their mobile orders never being ready when the truth is everyone and their momma is sending their order in between  am and  am so you are going to have a wait regardless karen do not yell at me because your  venti large overly sugared and complicated lattes are not ready in truth we needed a third espresso machine but we are lucky to have what we did remember fourth the management during the time i was there  months there was two store managers the manager that hired me left two months later we were without a store manager until about february/march the man that was a hired a truly kind man was an outside hire who was entirely new to starbucks he lasted  or  months i think no offense to him he did his best trying to make our store better and they ran him off he left at the beginning of july we were without a set store manager for the month of august and instead of us getting a new one they pinned our store onto another store manager! she does not answer texts you can only call her when you did call her you got voicemailed and if you or what you had to say was not considered important good luck getting a response! i asked to have a meeting with district manager to discuss all of these issues above and yet was met with contempt because i was “supposed” to reach out to the temporary store manager who had her own store to run and does not answer calls i never fully got to express any of this to anyone but other baristas at work who were also fed up i am grateful for the wonderful people i met but i implore you if you have read this far to go to a local coffee shop the whole company needs to unionize there is no reason our store should be as dilapidated as it is when we are one of the top earning stores sbux ceo can get a billion dollar bonus and we cannot get new machines there is way way more i could share but i close with this: grateful to have learned what i did met who i did it was a complete learning experience i am just all in all disappointed i wanted to work there since i was  years old sad that my expectations were not met by this forbes listed company to work for sad that they run off everyone who actually cares and wants to make the stores a better place\n",

            "Cleaned text: i see a lot of people confused about specifics of starbucks drinks or not understanding things about what they order that is by no means the customers fault i actually have a tiny beef with how limited and opaque the printed menu is but i figured i would try to clear a little up feel free to add more or ask questions in the comments but here are some ahem true facts about the starbucks menu  frappuccinos can be made with or without coffee ask for creme base or add \"creme\" to the name ex caramel creme frappuccino if you want the drink without coffee chai matcha and strawberries and creme are the only ones that do not come with coffee as a default this also means that the ever popular vanilla bean creme frappuccino does not include coffee  speaking of fraps they are not made with espresso shots unless you ask they use a special coffee blend called frappuccino roast and a coffee flavored syrup base  any espresso drink can be made decaf this does not include tea lattes iced teas or refreshers as none of them include espresso shots frappuccinos can be made decaf by replacing frap roast with a decaf shot  refreshers do have caffeine they may taste like juice but they are actually made with green coffee bean extract to give them caffeine it is not as much as coffee though only about mg roughly the amount that is in black tea  there is more than what is on the menu while i understand why this frustrates me starbucks relies on being part of peoples routine which means they expect people to know what they want and keep ordering what they have always ordered our options are extensive so they do not want to print off every single one on our posters at the moment only four or five of our twenty frappuccinos are listed or featured if there is something specific you are looking for whether it is a particular drink or just a flavor profile ask a barista edit: if you want a full menu ask for our large print/braille version every drink and food item we offer is there with descriptions a few items ex protein boxes are not available everywhere but you will see just how many options we have  there is however no secret menu the secret menu and tiktok drinks are not anything we are trained on some of the more common ones like a cotton candy frap the baristas might know but never rely on that instead have the recipe pulled up as a side note many of those drinks also rely on seasonal ingredients so maybe have a backup choice ready  iced teas are unsweetened by default most baristas will ask if you want your tea sweet or unsweetened but the default is to leave it out this changed somewhat recently so if you have noticed a change that might be why  we have kids drinks whether you are caffeine sensitive do not like coffee or do not want your child too hyped up we do have non-coffee drinks this includes hot/iced teas creme frappuccinos mentioned above hot chocolates apple cider regular or flavored milks juices steamers and sparkling waters  blonde has more caffeine this is true whether it is drip coffee or espresso shots blonde coffees are roasted less which gives them a less strong coffee taste but also leaves them with more caffeine many people assume darker roasts are more caffeinated but that is not the case  we have pourovers and french presses i will tell you right off the bat please do not order these if you are in a hurry or if we are incredibly busy they take time and take us out of our drink-making routine however if you are wanting to try a specific type of coffee wanting a roast that is not currently available or prefer your coffee brewed via a specific method feel free to ask  speaking of coffee refills can be free refills on hot coffee iced coffee cold brew and hot or iced teas cost  cents if you have the app however refills are free it is great for longer stays now that cafes are beginning to open up again  try new drinks! again please do not take advantage of this and please be mindful of how busy the store is if you are hesitant to try a new drink go ahead! if you like it great! if you do not let a barista know even at another store and we will make something else for you bonus trivia!  caramel macchiattos are made with vanilla syrup  iced coffee comes with classic syrup by default  we have very good blended strawberry lemonade  we offer small cups of whipped cream for dogs! or yourself i do not judge  java chips contain wheat and dairy!  for sweeter but more intense coffee taste ask for ristretto shots for a higher volume more watery shot ask for long shots ristretto shots will have slightly less caffeine though and long shots will have slightly more due to the differences in extraction time this has been corrected to reflect info from starbucks partner hub  espresso frappuccinos always come with one shot regardless of the size  a coffee based version of the vanilla bean creme frappuccino is actually a menu item! ask for the cafe vanilla frappuccino  refreshers are not teas they are actually juice bases  we have mugs! or we will ask for your hot or iced drink \"for here\" and post-plague you will receive your drink in a ceramic mug or a large glass addendums  vanilla sweet cream cold foam is not the same as just saying \"cold foam\" regular cold foam is just fluffed up nonfat milk with a few pumps of vanilla confirmed via partner hub this is especially important for mobile orders as you may not get what you are expecting if you ring up the wrong one via you/dazedandconfusedhere - decaf still has caffeine but it is about -mg per shot - caramel sauce/caramel drizzle white mocha dark caramel sauce and cinnamon dolce topping all have dairy in them - you can check the starbucks app for nutrition info and caffeine content of all of our menu items - starbucks does not train the baristas on the app or rewards options all we know is based on our own usage and many of us do not use the app at all! via you/e-zma - we can make any espresso drink blonde or decaf but we cannot make something blonde and decaf via you/snowflakenecklace - java chips have dairy as well - most seasonal drinks pumpkin spice toasted white mocha etc have dairy in the flavorings it is super easy to tell with this - sauces have dairy syrups do not the one exception is regular mocha - chai has honey useful info for vegans that avoid it! via you/social-introvert- - for kids you can get them whatever latte they say they want minus the coffee! we call steamed milk with the syrups “steamers”! so now little jr can enjoy a caramel macchiato just like his daddy likes but without the espresso! the kids will never know or care the coffee’s not in there and huge plus… steamers are delish! via you/selocavrap - there is no specific \"kids menu\" listed anywhere but there are kids sizes on some drinks & a kids lemonade is literally just a tall lemonade but cheaper via you/chewbacca_the_wookie and you/dazedandconfusedhere - even though a chai frap and matcha frap comes without frap roast it still has caffeine via you/chrismustree - the refresher inclusions do not change the flavor of the drink just the color if you do not like them order less or none ordering  scoops of inclusions will not make your drink taste “stronger”\n",
